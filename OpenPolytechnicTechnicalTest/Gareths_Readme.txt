Thanks, that was fun

There was a lot more that I could have done, and wanted to do, but time was ticking


Stuff that this was lacking:
1) comments
2) I didn't create the static instance that was specified
3) repetition of the string format stuff.
4) I targeted .Net 5.0 because I didn't want to spend time getting 6 working (i haven't installed that yet.)


I did break out the code into 2 other classes - seemed a nice way to separate concerns.




Happy grading,

Gareth
