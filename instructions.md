To undertake this test, you will need to be familiar with Git and have a Github account.

You will be invited to the repo: https://github.com/op-liam-oconnor/OpenPolytechnicTechnicalTest

Once you are invited, you will have 90 MINUTES to complete the test. You must commit and push your working branch before the 90 minutes is finished. Timestamps will be used to check compliance.

Steps:

1) 	Check out the repo.
2) 	Branch a working branch with the following name structure: Test-[First 3 Letters of Surname + First 3 Letters of First Name]-[Date in ISO Format]. 
	Eg: Test-ocolia-20210813T1355
3)  Do your work in your editor of choice. Yes, even Vi.
4)	Add your changes, commit your changes, push your working branch.
5)	Let us know the test is complete.

Being able to use Git is part of the test. We will not provide further support outside of these instructions. Good luck and have fun. :)
